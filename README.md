# Machine-Learning-project
Car Price Prediction in the American Market
This project focuses on analyzing factors affecting car prices in the American automobile market. A Chinese automobile company aspires to enter the U.S. market, and this project aims to build a predictive model for car prices, providing insights into key variables influencing pricing. These insights will assist in shaping design and business strategies tailored to the new market.

Project Objectives:
Understand significant factors that influence car prices.
Predict car prices using machine learning models based on available data.
Provide actionable insights for pricing strategies in the U.S. market.

Workflow:-
# Data Preprocessing:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Standardized numerical features for consistency.

# Model Implementation:
Built and evaluated five regression models
